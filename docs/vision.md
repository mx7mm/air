# Vision

## What is Air?

Air is a custom operating system that feels like something entirely new—not another Linux distribution.

When you turn on an Air device, you don't see a login screen, a terminal, or options. You see Air. One interface, one experience, one purpose.

## Core Principles

### 1. Invisible Infrastructure

The user never sees Linux, filesystems, or processes. They see apps and content. The technology disappears.

### 2. Cloud-Native

- Apps are delivered from the cloud
- Updates happen automatically
- User data syncs seamlessly
- The device is replaceable; the experience is not

### 3. Minimal by Design

Every component must justify its existence. If it doesn't serve the user, it doesn't ship.

### 4. Opinionated

Air makes decisions so users don't have to. One way to do things, done well.

## What Air Is Not

- Not a general-purpose Linux distribution
- Not a tinkering platform (no package manager, no terminal for users)
- Not backwards-compatible with traditional Linux software

## The End Goal

A user picks up an Air device. It connects to the network. Their environment appears—apps, data, settings. They use it. When they're done, they put it down.

No configuration. No maintenance. No friction.

That's Air.
