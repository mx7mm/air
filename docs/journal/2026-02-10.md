# 2026-02-10 – Project Restart

## Decisions Made

### 1. Level 1 Custom OS
We're building on the Linux kernel, not writing our own. This gives us:
- Hardware support out of the box
- Years of security hardening
- Focus on what matters: the user experience

### 2. Technology Stack
| Component | Choice | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Kernel | Linux | Hardware support, stability |
| libc | musl | Small, clean, modern |
| Graphics | Wayland | Modern, secure, simple |
| Compositor | Custom (wlroots) | Full control over UX |
| Build System | Buildroot | Proven, flexible |

### 3. Documentation First
Every term, decision, and build attempt gets documented. No tribal knowledge.

## What We Did

1. Deleted the old broken repo
2. Created new project structure
3. Wrote foundational documentation:
   - README.md
   - docs/vision.md
   - docs/glossary.md
   - docs/architecture.md
4. Set up build infrastructure (configs, scripts)

## Next Steps

1. Create minimal bootable system (kernel + init + shell)
2. Test in QEMU
3. Add Wayland compositor
4. First Air-branded boot screen

## Open Questions

- Target hardware: x86_64 only for now, or also ARM?
- App runtime: Web only, or also native?
