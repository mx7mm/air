# Milestone: v0.2 - Immutable Core

## Scope
- Deliver an immutable-first runtime baseline.
- Separate persistent writable state from system root.
- Validate boot behavior with read-only root and mounted `/data`.

## Delivered
- Root filesystem booted read-only (`ro` kernel flag).
- Init mounts volatile paths on tmpfs (`/run`, `/tmp`).
- Dedicated GPT `/data` partition added and mounted at boot.
- Runtime smoke check for immutable root behavior.

## Validation
- ARM64 image builds successfully with new partition model.
- Live QEMU checks confirmed:
  - `/` mounted as read-only.
  - `/data` mounted as writable ext4.
  - Persistence across reboot via `/data/persist-test`.

## Known Gaps
- No transactional OTA update mechanism yet.
- No A/B rollback strategy yet.

## Carry-over to Next Milestone
- Define and implement update orchestration (A/B or equivalent).
- Extend automated boot/runtime verification in CI.
