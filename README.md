# Air

**Air is a cloud-native operating system designed for zero-setup work.**

Air is not a Linux distribution.  
It is not a desktop environment.  
It is not a customization playground.

Air is built around one idea:

> Your work should follow you. Not your machine.

---

## Why Air Exists

Modern operating systems are:

- Stateful  
- Drift-prone  
- Configuration-heavy  
- Device-centered  

Air is different.

Air is:

- Immutable at its core  
- Identity-first  
- Workspace-driven  
- Designed to remove setup and maintenance  

You don’t configure Air.  
You sign in.

## Current Status

Air is in active development.

- **v0.1 — First Breath**  
  Air boots.

- **v0.2 — Immutable Core**  
  Root becomes read-only.

Air is not feature-complete.  
It is being built deliberately.

---

## Vision

Air replaces:

- File-first workflows  
- Device-bound environments  
- Manual setup cycles  

With:

- Context-driven workspaces  
- Stateless system architecture  
- Identity-centered computing  

Air is not trying to be everything.

Air is trying to be clear.
